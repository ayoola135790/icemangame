Ice Man Game CS30

# Descrption
  # Pt2
This was the final project that I made in my Advanced Programming in C++ class called Ice Man. This game was targeted towards my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, use of pointers, and classes. I learned so much from the project that fell into other principles in my computer science journey.
