# CS30-IceMan 
Ice Man Game CS30

# Descrption
This was the final project that I made in my Advanced Programming in C++ class called Ice Man. This game was targeted towards my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, use of pointers, and classes. 

This project contains IceMan, which encorporates multiple inheritance, algorithms, and data strucutures to create a working video games. 

This tested my ability to work in a team setting, developing and creating different code as well as utilize different code as well as utilize different code bases in order to create functional working code.
